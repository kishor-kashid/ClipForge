  - Empty states for all components
  - Progress bar for video export
- ✅ PR #10 Complete: Documentation and testing
  - Comprehensive README with usage instructions
  - All 64 tests passing
  - Code cleanup verified

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Test packaged app** (PENDING)
   - Install `ClipForge-1.0.0-setup.exe`
   - Test all features in packaged app
   - Verify import, preview, trim, export flow

2. **Create demo video** (PENDING)
   - Record 3-5 minute demo
   - Upload to YouTube or cloud storage
   - Show complete user workflow

3. **Create GitHub release** (PENDING)
   - Upload installer to GitHub
   - Add demo video link
   - Write release notes

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Choices Made
- **State Management**: React Context (simple, no external deps)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (rapid development)
- **Testing**: Vitest (Vite-native, fast)
- **FFmpeg**: ffmpeg-static (zero user setup friction)
- **Packaging**: electron-builder (NSIS installer)
- **Electron Placement**: devDependencies (required by electron-builder)

### Architecture Decisions
- **IPC Pattern**: Context bridge for security
- **File Handling**: Main process only
- **Progress Feedback**: IPC events from FFmpeg
- **Video Loading**: webSecurity: false for local file access
- **Trim State**: Stored in separate trimPoints state per video

### Current Enhancements
- **Export Button Validation**: Disabled when invalid trim points or no video
- **Seek Bar**: Added to VideoPlayer for scrubbing through video
- **Loading States**: Spinner shown while video loads
- **Duration Updates**: Auto-updates in store when video metadata loads

## Learning Notes

### Electron Concepts Applied
- Main process vs Renderer process separation ✅
- Context bridge API for secure IPC ✅
- IPC handlers for dialog/file operations ✅
- Window lifecycle management ✅
- File system access in main process ✅
- FFmpeg integration with fluent-ffmpeg ✅

### Implementation Patterns Applied
- Custom hooks for state access ✅
- useEffect for side effects ✅
- Error boundaries for component error handling ✅
- Async/await for FFmpeg operations ✅
- Progress tracking via IPC ✅

### Packaging Learnings
- electron must be in devDependencies, not dependencies
- Code signing can be disabled for development/testing
- electron-builder needs `webSecurity: false` config to load local files
- FFmpeg progress events need fallback timer for reliability

## Risk Mitigation

### Mitigated Risks
1. **IPC Communication Complexity**: ✅ Working with context bridge
2. **FFmpeg Not Working**: ✅ Using ffmpeg-static successfully
3. **Packaging Issues**: ✅ Tested early, configured correctly
4. **File Path Issues**: ✅ Using direct paths with webSecurity disabled
5. **Time Pressure**: ✅ Completed all PRs ahead of schedule

### Remaining Risks
- **Demo Video**: Need to record before submission
- **Packaged App Testing**: Need to verify all features work in installer
- **Unknown Bugs**: Only discoverable through thorough testing

## Next Milestone
**Milestone**: Ready for Submission
**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All MVP features implemented
- ✅ All tests passing (64/64)
- ✅ App packaged successfully
- ⏳ Packaged app tested
- ⏳ Demo video recorded
- ⏳ GitHub release created

## Active Questions
- None currently - app is functionally complete

## Configuration Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed index.html location (moved from public/ to root)
- ✅ Fixed PostCSS config (CommonJS syntax, Tailwind v4)
- ✅ Fixed Electron dev detection (using app.isPackaged)
- ✅ Fixed Tailwind CSS v4 setup (@tailwindcss/postcss plugin)
- ✅ Fixed electron-builder config (moved electron to devDependencies)
- ✅ Fixed code signing (disabled for development)
- ✅ Fixed FFmpeg progress tracking (workaround for unreliable events)
- ✅ Fixed video loading (set webSecurity: false)

## Communication Notes
- User has reviewed PRD and architecture
- Completed all implementation tasks
- Ready for final testing and submission
