### Immediate Next Steps (Final Submission Requirements)
1. **Advanced Timeline Features** (PR #15-#18)
   - Drag clips onto timeline
   - Split clips at playhead position
   - Multiple tracks support (at least 2 tracks)
   - Zoom in/out on timeline

2. **Advanced Export Features** (PR #19)
   - Resolution options (720p, 1080p, source)
   - Cloud upload (bonus feature)

3. **Submission Materials** (PR #20)
   - Test all recording features (screen, webcam, audio, PiP)
   - Record 3-5 minute demo video
   - Create GitHub release with installer
   - Package app for final submission

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Choices Made
- **State Management**: React Context (simple, no external deps)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (rapid development)
- **Testing**: Vitest (Vite-native, fast)
- **FFmpeg**: ffmpeg-static (zero user setup friction)
- **Packaging**: electron-builder (NSIS installer)
- **Electron Placement**: devDependencies (required by electron-builder)
- **Screen Recording**: desktopCapturer API (Electron native)
- **Media Recording**: MediaRecorder API (Web API with Electron support)
- **Canvas Compositing**: HTML5 Canvas for PiP overlay
- **Media Devices**: getUserMedia API for webcam/microphone access

### Architecture Decisions
- **IPC Pattern**: Context bridge for security
- **File Handling**: Main process only
- **Progress Feedback**: IPC events from FFmpeg
- **Video Loading**: webSecurity: false for local file access
- **Trim State**: Stored in separate trimPoints state per video
- **Recording Architecture**: 
  - RecordingPanel handles Screen/Webcam/Audio modes
  - PipRecorder handles composite PiP recording separately
  - Screen sources fetched via IPC from main process
  - Recordings saved using Blob → Uint8Array → IPC → fs.writeFile
  - Animation loop uses requestAnimationFrame for canvas drawing
  - Stream cleanup in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks

### Current Enhancements
- **Professional UI**: Complete dark theme redesign for video editor aesthetic
- **Export Button Validation**: Disabled when invalid trim points or no video
- **Seek Bar**: Functional progress bar with blue accent and smooth animations
- **Loading States**: Spinner shown while video loads
- **Duration Updates**: Auto-updates in store when video metadata loads
- **Video Display**: Fixed overlay blocking issue, video now displays properly
- **Color Palette**: Consistent use of professional dark grays and blue accents
- **Recording Panel**: Right-side panel with Screen/Webcam mode tabs
- **PiP Recorder**: Separate component with canvas compositing for simultaneous recording
- **Source Selection**: Dropdown to choose screen/window sources explicitly
- **Device Selection**: Camera and microphone dropdowns for user control

## Learning Notes

### Electron Concepts Applied
- Main process vs Renderer process separation ✅
- Context bridge API for secure IPC ✅
- IPC handlers for dialog/file operations ✅
- Window lifecycle management ✅
- File system access in main process ✅
- FFmpeg integration with fluent-ffmpeg ✅
- desktopCapturer API for screen recording ✅
- MediaRecorder for capturing media streams ✅
- getUserMedia for webcam/microphone access ✅

### Implementation Patterns Applied
- Custom hooks for state access ✅
- useEffect for side effects ✅
- Error boundaries for component error handling ✅
- Async/await for FFmpeg operations ✅
- Progress tracking via IPC ✅
- Canvas-based video compositing for PiP ✅
- requestAnimationFrame for smooth canvas updates ✅
- MediaStream management and cleanup ✅
- Blob to ArrayBuffer conversion for IPC ✅
- Device enumeration for user selection ✅

### Packaging Learnings
- electron must be in devDependencies, not dependencies
- Code signing can be disabled for development/testing
- electron-builder needs `webSecurity: false` config to load local files
- FFmpeg progress events need fallback timer for reliability

### Recording Implementation Learnings
- desktopCapturer requires explicit screen vs window source selection
- MediaRecorder needs codec fallback (VP9 → VP8 → WebM default)
- Canvas animation loop must check for active streams, not just recording state
- Hidden video elements prevent proper loading; use off-screen positioning instead
- Screen source IDs starting with "screen:" indicate full screen capture
- Blob data must be converted to Uint8Array for IPC transmission
- MediaStreams must be explicitly stopped to release device resources

## Risk Mitigation

### Mitigated Risks
1. **IPC Communication Complexity**: ✅ Working with context bridge
2. **FFmpeg Not Working**: ✅ Using ffmpeg-static successfully
3. **Packaging Issues**: ✅ Tested early, configured correctly
4. **File Path Issues**: ✅ Using direct paths with webSecurity disabled
5. **Recording Features**: ✅ All 4 recording modes implemented and tested
6. **Screen Capture Issues**: ✅ Fixed source selection and animation loop
7. **PiP Complexity**: ✅ Isolated in separate component with canvas compositing

### Remaining Risks
- **Timeline Advanced Features**: Drag, split, multi-track, zoom need implementation
- **Export Options**: Resolution selection not yet implemented
- **Demo Video**: Need to record showing all features
- **Packaged App Testing**: Need to verify recordings work in packaged app
- **Time Pressure**: ~56 hours remaining, multiple PRs still needed

## Next Milestone
**Milestone**: Ready for Final Submission
**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All MVP features implemented (PR #1-10)
- ✅ Recording features implemented (PR #11-14)
  - ✅ Screen recording
  - ✅ Webcam recording
  - ✅ Audio capture
  - ✅ PiP recording
- ⏳ Timeline advanced features (PR #15-18)
- ⏳ Export advanced features (PR #19)
- ⏳ Submission materials (PR #20)
  - ⏳ Test all features
  - ⏳ Demo video recorded
  - ⏳ GitHub release created

## Active Questions
- Should we prioritize timeline advanced features or export options?
- Is cloud upload bonus feature worth the implementation time?
- What level of testing is expected for recording features?

## Configuration Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed index.html location (moved from public/ to root)
- ✅ Fixed PostCSS config (CommonJS syntax, Tailwind v4)
- ✅ Fixed Electron dev detection (using app.isPackaged)
- ✅ Fixed Tailwind CSS v4 setup (@tailwindcss/postcss plugin)
- ✅ Fixed electron-builder config (moved electron to devDependencies)
- ✅ Fixed code signing (disabled for development)
- ✅ Fixed FFmpeg progress tracking (workaround for unreliable events)
- ✅ Fixed video loading (set webSecurity: false)
- ✅ Fixed video player black screen (adjusted overlay button rendering logic)
- ✅ Fixed slider display (implemented linear-gradient background for progress bar visibility)
- ✅ Fixed PiP animation loop (check active streams, not recording state)
- ✅ Fixed screen source selection (filter by type 'screen', user dropdown)
- ✅ Fixed canvas video rendering (use off-screen positioning, not hidden class)

## Communication Notes
