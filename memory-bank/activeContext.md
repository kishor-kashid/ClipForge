  - Cleaned: Timeline.jsx (2 logs), videoStore.jsx (2 logs), keyboardShortcuts.js (6 logs)
  - Cleaned: electron/openaiHandlers.js (4 logs), electron/openaiClient.js (1 log)
  - Kept: Essential error/warn logs for production debugging
- ✅ **Code Simplification**:
  - Fixed keyboard shortcuts to use correct function names (setTrimIn/setTrimOut)
  - Corrected delete clip functionality to use removeClipFromTrack properly
  - Removed unused imports (addVideo, removeVideo from keyboardShortcuts)
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**:
  - Memoized `getVideosInTimeline()` using React.useMemo to prevent unnecessary recalculations
  - Optimized Timeline component rendering when tracks/clips haven't changed
- ✅ **Test Results**: All 93 tests passing after refactoring

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Choices Made
- **State Management**: React Context (simple, no external deps)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (rapid development)
- **Testing**: Vitest (Vite-native, fast)
- **FFmpeg**: ffmpeg-static (zero user setup friction)
- **Packaging**: electron-builder (NSIS installer)
- **Electron Placement**: devDependencies (required by electron-builder)
- **Screen Recording**: desktopCapturer API (Electron native)
- **Media Recording**: MediaRecorder API (Web API with Electron support)
- **Canvas Compositing**: HTML5 Canvas for PiP overlay
- **Media Devices**: getUserMedia API for webcam/microphone access

### Architecture Decisions
- **IPC Pattern**: Context bridge for security
- **File Handling**: Main process only
- **Progress Feedback**: IPC events from FFmpeg
- **Video Loading**: webSecurity: false for local file access
- **Trim State**: Stored in separate trimPoints state per video
- **Recording Architecture**: 
  - RecordingPanel handles Screen/Webcam/Audio modes
  - PipRecorder handles composite PiP recording separately
  - Screen sources fetched via IPC from main process
  - Recordings saved using Blob → Uint8Array → IPC → fs.writeFile
  - Animation loop uses requestAnimationFrame for canvas drawing
  - Stream cleanup in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks
- **Timeline Architecture**:
  - Multi-track state management with tracks array
  - Clip positioning based on startTime and effective duration
  - Drag-and-drop with visual feedback and position calculation
  - Split clips maintain originalPath reference for video loading
  - Effective duration calculation from trim points (inPoint/outPoint)
  - Visual differentiation for split clips (purple styling, badges)
  - Timeline export with filter-free FFmpeg approach
  - Parallel processing for individual clip normalization
  - Concat demuxer for reliable multi-track concatenation

### Current Enhancements
- **Professional UI Design System**: 
  - Comprehensive CSS variables for colors, shadows, spacing, typography
  - Standardized button system (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Success, Danger)
  - Consistent spacing scale and typography hierarchy
  - Professional shadows and elevation system
  - Enhanced form inputs with focus states
  - Improved empty states and loading indicators

  - Resizable panels (200-600px range) with drag handles
  - Maximize video player button (full-screen mode)
  - Adjustable timeline height (150-600px) with drag handle
  - Keyboard shortcuts for quick panel management (1, 3, F keys)
  - Current video name display in header
  - Reduced panel padding (16px) for more content space
- **Professional Video Editor Features**:
  - Export Button Validation: Disabled when invalid trim points or no video
  - Seek Bar: Functional progress bar with blue accent and smooth animations
  - Loading States: Spinner shown while video loads
  - Duration Updates: Auto-updates in store when video metadata loads

- **Device Selection**: Camera and microphone dropdowns for user control
- **Timeline Advanced**: Drag-and-drop with visual feedback and position calculation
- **Multi-Track Support**: 2+ tracks with add/remove controls and visual track headers
- **Clip Splitting**: Split button in VideoPlayer with trim point validation
- **Visual Differentiation**: Purple styling and "SPLIT" badges for split clips
- **Effective Duration**: Timeline shows correct durations based on trim points
- **Timeline Export**: Multi-track concatenation with progress tracking and error handling
- **Filter-Free Approach**: Eliminated FFmpeg filter network errors using inputOptions
- **Parallel Processing**: 2-5x speed improvement for multi-clip exports
- **Timeline Video Library**: Filtered view showing only videos used in tracks

## Learning Notes

### Electron Concepts Applied
- Main process vs Renderer process separation ✅
- Context bridge API for secure IPC ✅
- IPC handlers for dialog/file operations ✅
- Window lifecycle management ✅
- File system access in main process ✅
- FFmpeg integration with fluent-ffmpeg ✅
- desktopCapturer API for screen recording ✅
- MediaRecorder for capturing media streams ✅
- getUserMedia for webcam/microphone access ✅

### Implementation Patterns Applied
- Custom hooks for state access ✅
- useEffect for side effects ✅
- Error boundaries for component error handling ✅
- Async/await for FFmpeg operations ✅
- Progress tracking via IPC ✅
- Canvas-based video compositing for PiP ✅
- requestAnimationFrame for smooth canvas updates ✅
- MediaStream management and cleanup ✅
- Blob to ArrayBuffer conversion for IPC ✅
- Device enumeration for user selection ✅
- Drag-and-drop with visual feedback ✅
- Multi-track state management ✅
- Clip splitting with trim point validation ✅
- Effective duration calculation from trim points ✅

### Packaging Learnings
- electron must be in devDependencies, not dependencies
- Code signing can be disabled for development/testing
- electron-builder needs `webSecurity: false` config to load local files
- FFmpeg progress events need fallback timer for reliability

### Recording Implementation Learnings
- desktopCapturer requires explicit screen vs window source selection
- MediaRecorder needs codec fallback (VP9 → VP8 → WebM default)
- Canvas animation loop must check for active streams, not just recording state
- Hidden video elements prevent proper loading; use off-screen positioning instead
- Screen source IDs starting with "screen:" indicate full screen capture
- Blob data must be converted to Uint8Array for IPC transmission
- MediaStreams must be explicitly stopped to release device resources

### Timeline Implementation Learnings
- Drag-and-drop requires mouse coordinate to timeline position calculation
- Clip positioning needs both startTime and effective duration for accurate display
- Split clips must maintain originalPath reference for video loading
- Effective duration calculation requires trim point validation (inPoint/outPoint)
- Visual feedback improves user experience (drop indicators, color coding)
- Multi-track state management requires careful clip-to-track relationships
- FFmpeg concatenation works well for sequential clip export
- Filter-free approach eliminates FFmpeg filter network errors
- Parallel processing provides 2-5x speed improvement for multi-clip exports
- Concat demuxer is most reliable for multi-track concatenation
- Timeline Video Library filtering improves user experience
