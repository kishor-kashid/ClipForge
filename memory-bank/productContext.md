# ClipForge - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Project Status
**ðŸŽ‰ COMPLETE**: All 20 PRs implemented and tested
- âœ… MVP implementation (PR #1-10)
- âœ… Recording features (PR #11-14)
- âœ… Timeline advanced features (PR #16-17)
- âœ… Advanced export features (PR #18)
- âœ… Testing suite (PR #19)

### The Problem
Content creators need simple video editing capabilities without the learning curve and complexity of professional editing software. Many existing solutions are either:
- Overly complex with features they don't need
- Expensive subscription-based services
- Web-based with upload/download limitations
- Lacking basic functionality

### The Solution
ClipForge provides a focused, desktop-based video editor with comprehensive features: import, preview, trim, export, recording, timeline editing, and multi-track support. It runs locally, processes files quickly, and requires no cloud services or subscriptions.

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity First
- **One workflow**: Import â†’ Preview â†’ Trim â†’ Export
- **No jargon**: Clear, everyday language in the UI
- **Immediate feedback**: Visual indicators for all actions
- **No hidden steps**: Everything the user needs is visible
- **Professional shortcuts**: Industry-standard keyboard shortcuts

### Fast & Efficient
- **Local processing**: No upload delays or bandwidth concerns
- **Quick preview**: Start playback almost instantly
- **Straightforward trimming**: Set points and export
- **Reliable export**: One-button export process
- **Parallel processing**: 2-5x faster multi-clip exports

### Confidence Building
- **Clear visual feedback**: Timeline shows what's imported
- **Playback verification**: See exactly what will be exported
- **Trim validation**: Prevent invalid settings (in > out)
- **Export confirmation**: Know when export completes successfully
- **Undo/redo system**: Full history management with keyboard shortcuts

## How It Should Work

### User Journey 1: Quick Trim
1. User drags a video file into the app
2. Timeline shows the imported clip
3. User plays video in preview player
4. User sets start point at 00:15 (in-point)
5. User sets end point at 01:30 (out-point)
6. User clicks "Export to MP4"
7. App processes trim and saves file
8. User gets valid MP4 with 01:15 duration

### User Journey 2: Multiple Clips âœ… IMPLEMENTED
1. User clicks "Import Video" button
2. File picker opens, user selects 3 clips
3. Timeline displays all 3 clips
4. User clicks different clips to preview each
5. User selects clip 2 and sets trim points
6. User exports clip 2 with trimming applied

### User Journey 3: Screen Recording âœ… IMPLEMENTED
1. User clicks "Start Screen Recording"
2. App shows screen source selection
3. User selects entire screen or specific window
4. User clicks "Start Recording"
5. App records screen with live preview
6. User clicks "Stop Recording"
7. Recording automatically added to timeline
8. User can trim and export the recording

### User Journey 4: Multi-Track Timeline âœ… IMPLEMENTED
1. User imports multiple videos
2. User drags videos to different timeline tracks
3. User arranges clips in desired order
4. User sets trim points for each clip
5. User splits clips at playhead position
6. User exports entire timeline as single video
7. App concatenates all clips with parallel processing
8. User gets single MP4 with all clips combined
