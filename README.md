# ClipForge

A desktop video editor for trimming and exporting videos. Built with Electron, React, and FFmpeg.

## 🎬 Features

- **Video Import**: Drag & drop or file picker to import videos (MP4, MOV, WebM)
- **Timeline View**: Visual timeline showing all imported clips
- **Video Preview**: Play imported videos with playback controls and seek bar
- **Trim Controls**: Set in/out points for video trimming
- **Export**: Export trimmed videos to MP4 format
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress during video export

## 📋 System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10 or later
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: ~200MB for app installation
- **Graphics**: Any graphics card that supports hardware acceleration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ClipForge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts the Vite dev server and opens the Electron app.

### Build for Production

1. **Build the React app**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Package for Windows**
   ```bash
   npm run electron:build
   ```

   This creates a Windows installer (`ClipForge-1.0.0-setup.exe`) in the `dist/` directory.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Video won't load
- Ensure the video file is a supported format (MP4, MOV, WebM)
- Check that the file path is valid and the file exists
- Try importing a different video file

### Export fails
- Make sure you have enough disk space at the destination
- Check that the output path is writable
- Ensure trim points are valid (out-point > in-point)
- Verify the source video file is not corrupted

### App won't start
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again
- Check Node.js version is 18 or later
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly

### FFmpeg errors
- The app includes ffmpeg-static, no manual installation needed
- If export fails, check the console for detailed error messages
- Ensure the input video file is valid and readable
